# Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?

It was very useful, I liked the hands-on approach very much!
The level was just the right balance between easy topics and more tricky ones.

# Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
Most familiar topic was probably Hue/HDFS. Least familiar was definitely Kerberos and Sentry
# Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
Kerberos was very interesting and definitely helpful. I wouldn't say there were unuseful topics
# How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
I think I need to practice the entire process another couple times on training machines, mostly to straighten a couple details I think.
